# pyGravity

Simple gravity simulator. Upon launch, create a window. Right click adds 
a stationnary planet/body, left click a mobile body which will orbit 
other bodies present in the simulation. The trajectories were computed using RK4
methods.

The simulation can be paused by pressing the space bar. By clicking on a body,
a windows will appear which allow to add a name, change its mass and/or its density. 
The simulation is automatically centered on the largest body.

Launch via python3 main.py

### Prerequisites

pygame and tkinter.
